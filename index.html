    </h1>

    <p>TTime is (breath) a rewrite of a fork of a replacement of an updated
    version of software intended to help Technion students organize their
    timetables. (That was UDonkey-mono, UDonkey.Net, Marprog-Windows,
    Marprog-DOS). It automatically fetches its data from the Technion, and then
    generates automated schedules for the user according to his selections. We
    intend to make this program easy-to-use and extensible.</p>

    <p>While this is technically a rewrite, a lot of concepts and code were
    borrowed from UDonkey, so thanks!</p>

    <h2>Developers</h2>

    Want a crack at the source code? Interested in developing new Constraint or
    Rating plugins? Check out
    <a href="http://github.com/lutzky/ttime">the Git repository</a> for the
    source code. To get hacking quickly,
    <a href="http://git-scm.org">install git</a>
    and clone the repository:

    <pre>
    git clone git://github.com/lutzky/ttime.git</pre>

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>

    <p>The following screenshots are from the Hebrew version.</p>

    <p>The main view, displaying the course list (filtered by a search) and the
    currently selected courses.  Note that the search was performed by the
    course's nickname, not its full name.</p>

    <p>The exam schedule, generated from the selected courses.</p>

    <p>The Constraints tab allows you to show only schedules matching the
    selected contraints. All constraints are optional, including the "<i>No
	    clashes</i>" constraint (so schedules with clashes can be
    found).</p>

    <h2><a name="vs_udonkey" />More about TTime vs. UDonkey</h2>

	    <p>In the beginning, there was MarProg, an ancient program for
	    working with REPY files, for which the lore (and source code) have
	    been lost in the mists of time... This program was available for DOS
	    and WIN32 (essentially, Windows 95).</p>

	    <p>Then there was UDonkey, written by Yehuda Arkin, Alon Jacobi,
	    Yaniv Raziel and Yaniv Gardi, as a project for the Technion EE
	    faculty, under the supervision of Nissim Natanov and Dr. Ilana
	    David. This program was written in C#, but has only been tested
	    under Windows (e.g., not on Linux). The source code for UDonkey was
	    made available.</p>

	    <p>A group of students - namely, Haggai Eran, Boaz Goldstein and
	    myself (Ohad Lutzky), started hacking at UDonkey to get it to work
	    under Linux (using Mono), but eventually decided to rewrite it in
	    Ruby. This was a hobbyist project (i.e., no academic points were
	    granted).</p>

	    <p>Since we get asked about this a lot, here is a summary of the
	    differences between UDonkey (as described on September 18th, 2009)
	    and TTime 0.9.1.</p>

	    <p>Here are some things UDonkey does better than TTime:</p>
	    <ul>
		    <li>Better Windows compatibility - written in C#, which is a
		    first-class citizen on modern Windows operating
		    systems.</li>
		    <li>Full XML support - the REPY file gets converted into an
		    XML file first, which UDonkey operates directly on. The
		    support for this in TTime is experimental, and considered
		    second-class (at least until the Technion starts offering
		    compatible XML files officially).</li>
		    <li>Export schedule to HTML for easy printing using a
		    browser. (TTime exports to PDF for printing).</li>
		    <li>Export course information to HTML.</li>
		    <li>Allows users to define their own events.</li>
		    <li>Allows the inclusion of any set of days in the schedule,
		    including Friday and Saturday.</li>
		    <li>Automatically joins parallel lectures and tutorials held
		    in the same day at the same time.</a>
	    </ul>

	    <p>Here are some things TTime does better than UDonkey:</p>

	    <ul>
		    <li>Better Linux support, with very easy installation on
		    Debian and Ubuntu systems (dependencies are managed
		    automatically).</li>
		    <li>Much, <i>much</i> faster parsing of REPY files.</li>
		    <li>Simpler, friendlier user interface, written according to
		    the Human Interface Guidelines. Also, supports window
		    resizing.</li>
		    <li>Very flexible constraint and sorting system, right up to
		    optimizing the schedule for minimal running between
		    buildings (when there is no break).</li>
		    <li>Manual-Dynamic style schedule building, as suggested by
		    Tom Meiri - all options are displayed side-by-side, and the
		    user manually makes his choice. This has been compared to
		    planning your schedule using Excel or slides, but without
		    errors copying from the UG site.</li>
		    <li>UI available in English and Hebrew.</li>
	    </ul>
