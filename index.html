    </h1>

    <p>TTime is (breath) a rewrite of a fork of a replacement of an updated
    version of software intended to help Technion students organize their
    timetables. (That was UDonkey-mono, UDonkey.Net, Marprog-Windows,
    Marprog-DOS). It automatically fetches its data from the Technion, and then
    generates automated schedules for the user according to his selections. We
    intend to make this program easy-to-use and extensible.</p>

    <p>While this is technically a rewrite, a lot of concepts and code were
    borrowed from UDonkey, so thanks!</p>

    currently selected courses.  Note that the search was performed by the
    course's nickname, not its full name.</p>

    <p>The Constraints tab allows you to show only schedules matching the
    selected contraints. All constraints are optional, including the "<i>No
	    clashes</i>" constraint (so schedules with clashes can be
    found).</p>
