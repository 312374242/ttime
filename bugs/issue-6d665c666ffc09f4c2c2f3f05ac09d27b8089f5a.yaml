title: Null assertion on no search results
desc: |-
  When search doesn't return any results, we get the following warning:
  
    /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/gettext.rb: line 154
       Gtk-CRITICAL **:gtk_tree_model_row_has_child_toggled: assertion `path != NULL' failed
  
  It might be possible to solve this by setting visible_column and updating
  accordingly, but it might be more costly.
