title: More elegant course info display
desc: |-
  The course info textview (displayed at the bottom of the Course List view)
  doesn't look as good as it should.
  
  * The gray background (caused by sensitive=false) is ugly
  * No formatting used (unlike event info textview in schedule)
  * Missing data shown ("Lecturer: *blank*", etc.)
