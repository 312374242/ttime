h1. TTime - A Techinon Timetable utility

This is the Ruby version of TTime. To run it, you'll need the following
packages (for ruby1.8):

* rake
* ruby1.8
* libzip-ruby1.8
* libgettext-ruby1.8
* libglade2-ruby1.8
* libgtk2-ruby1.8

For now, we're using mozembed for our calendar rendering, so you'll also
need:

* libgtk-mozembed-ruby1.8

For the Cairo calendar renderer, you'll want:

* libpango1-ruby1.8
* librsvg2-ruby1.8
* libcairo-ruby1.8
