h1. About TTime

TTime is (breath) a rewrite of a fork of a replacement of an updated version of
software intended to help Technion students organize their timetables. (That
was UDonkey-mono, UDonkey.Net, Marprog-Windows, Marprog-DOS). It automatically
fetches its data from the Technion, and then generates automated schedules for
the user according to his selections. We intend to make this program
easy-to-use and extensible.

While this is technically a rewrite, a lot of concepts and code were borrowed
from UDonkey, so thanks!

h2. Licensing

This program's license is the GNU GPL. We don't have everything stamped with it

The version being actively developed is the *Ruby* one, so please take a look
